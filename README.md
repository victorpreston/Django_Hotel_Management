### In order to download and run the project ( It is assumed that Python 3 is already installed ):
1. Install Django and Apps:
```shell
pip install Django==3.1.4
pip install django-phonenumber-field[phonenumbers]
```
## Needed to create roles and admin account to add new employee accounts
2. Change Directory to Django---Hotel-Management-System/HMS and start the Shell:
```shell
python3 manage.py shell
```
* Then execute these, one by one:
```shell
from django.contrib.auth.models import Group, User
```

```shell
from accounts.models import Employee
```

```shell
Group.objects.create(name='admin')
```

```shell
Group.objects.create(name='manager')
```

```shell
Group.objects.create(name='receptionist')
```

```shell
Group.objects.create(name='staff')
```

```shell
Group.objects.create(name='guest')
```

```shell
user = User.createuser=User.objects.create_user('admin', password='admin123')
```

```shell
group = Group.objects.get(name="admin")
```

```shell
user.groups.add(group)
```

```shell
admin = Employee(user=user, salary=0)
```

```shell
admin.save()
```

### Finally:
* Exit the shell and set the database: 
```shell
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```
Then, start the surver
```shell
python3 manage.py runserver
```
* This will work if correctly set up.

## Notes:
#### Note 1: In the program, there are some payment page. No need to enter real credit-card informations. The payment page is just for the system, it doesnt work. However; after this page, a verification code is sent the user email address.


#### Note 2: You can only sign up as a guest to the system. In order to add employee (Manager - Receptionist - Staff): 
* Login in to the system with username: "admin" and password : "admin123"
* Go the employee page on options in navbar.
* Click "Add New Employee" button, fill the form and send it.
* You will see the success message. Then, you can use that employee to enter the system 


#### Note 3: For the email system (In some cases system sends e-mails):
* Go to the HMS/setting.py
* Under the settings file you can find the email settings, uncomment them in order to change the settings and put the email address you want to use to receive the rmails from the system.
